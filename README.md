Description: 

 This project focuses on the design and implementation of a simple synchronous RAM (Random Access Memory) module using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog. The primary objective is to create a memory block that supports synchronous read and write operations, fully controlled by a system clock. Synchronous RAM plays a vital role in digital systems by allowing data to be stored and retrieved in an organized, time-controlled manner.

The module will be designed to simulate real-world RAM functionality found in processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), and microcontrollers, providing a fundamental understanding of memory operation in synchronous digital systems.
